Even if you get stuck, please go through the rest of the instructions and download all the things you'll need. Bandwidth will be at a premium during the workshop, so it will help immensely to have everything on your laptop already.

There are a lot of steps, and the instructions may seem like they're in a foreign language, but: **don't panic!** By the end of the workshop, you'll know what everything is and how to use it.

step "Read This Overview" do

Here's a list of tools you'll be installing. As you go through the workshop, we'll explain what each one is for and how to use it.

* **Google Chrome**. A web browser with strong developer tools.
* **Slack**. A communication tool for teams.
* **Git**. A revision or source control system. It creates a repository, which is a complete history of your programming changes, so you can undo changes and roll back to previous versions of your work if something has gone wrong.
* **GitHub**.
* **Atom**. To write programs in Javascript, you need a text editor to create, edit and save Javascript files.

If you've already installed the above tools and are confident they are setup correctly, make sure you are a member of the Denver-Railsbridge slack channel (<a href="http://denver-railsbridge.herokuapp.com/">link</a>). Then, skip ahead to the <a href="create-a-webpage">Create a Webpage</a> step.
